I am Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). In my dissertation project, I examine the politicization of the energy transition, focusing on housing as a channel through which political preferences change over time. Specifically, I am interested in how homeowners perceive the economic consequences of the energy transition, and how these perceptions shape their sense of economic security.

More broadly, I am interested in the political consequences of progressive policies implemented by left-wing parties that benefit higher income groups, and when these make or break winning electoral coalitions.

  <summary>ABSTRACT</summary>
  <p>How do climate subsidies affect support for Green parties? Lately, climate policies have shifted from imposing costs through carbon pricing to offering benefits via subsidies. Research shows that policies imposing concentrated costs provoke electoral backlash. But what happens when the benefits of climate policies are concentrated, while costs remain diffuse? This study examines how renewable energy subsidies for rooftop solar panels influence political behaviour in Germany. I argue that solar panel investments allow homeowners to build environmentally conscious wealth, aligning pre-existing concerns about climate change with self-interested pro-environmental actions. Using administrative and panel survey data with difference-in-differences designs, I show that only homeowners are more likely to support the Greens after installing solar panels, and that the effects last in the long term. Longitudinal evidence indicates that this shift results from homeowners perceiving economic benefits and engaging directly with other aspects of the energy transition, consistent with the Green Party agenda. These findings suggest that climate subsidies can generate an endogenous source of support for fast-tracking the climate transition, albeit at the cost of increasing wealth inequality between recipients and non-recipients.</p>
