I am Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). In my dissertation project, I examine the politicization of the energy transition, focusing on housing as a channel through which political preferences change over time. Specifically, I am interested in how homeowners perceive the economic consequences of the energy transition, and how these perceptions shape their sense of economic security.

More broadly, I am interested in the political consequences of progressive policies implemented by left-wing parties that benefit higher income groups, and when these make or break winning electoral coalitions.
