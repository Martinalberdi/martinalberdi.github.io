I am Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). I will be a visiting student at Princeton University in the fall semester 2024. In my dissertation project, I examine how climate policies influence political behavior, focusing on how energy policies affect homeowners' perceptions of economic well-being within different *types* of energy transitions. I ground my thesis in the social insurance literature, arguing that climate policies enable some groups to build ecological wealth. More broadly, I am interested in the political consequences of progressive policies implemented by left-wing parties that benefit higher income groups, and when these make or break winning electoral coalitions.

[Building Eco-Wealth: How Climate Subsidies Shape Support for the Greens.](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/ysvuq)

*Abstract*

How do climate subsidies affect support for Green parties? Lately, climate policies have shifted from distributing costs through carbon pricing to offering benefits via subsidies. Research shows that policies imposing concentrated costs provoke electoral backlash. However, what happens when the benefits of climate policies are concentrated and the costs are diffuse? This study examines how climate subsidies for rooftop solar panels influence political behavior in Germany. I argue that solar panel investments allow homeowners to self-insure by increasing their ecological wealth, improving their perception of the economic benefits of the energy transition, and strengthening support for ambitious climate policies. Using difference-in-differences designs, I show that homeowners are more likely to support the Greens after purchasing solar panels. This self-insurance function of climate subsidies suggests that material incentives can provide a distinct source of support for fast-tracking the climate transition, albeit at the cost of benefiting wealthy homeowners.
