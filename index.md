  <div class="intro">
    <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the European University Institute. My research lies at the intersection of climate politics, policy feedback, and political behavior. 
    I investigate how the design and implementation of green policies—especially those affecting housing and household assets—shape political preferences and electoral outcomes. 
    My dissertation explains how these policies commodify the energy transition through homeownership, transforming housing into marketable assets that can have downstream political consequences on perceptions of social inclusion and voting behavior.</p>

          How do climate subsidies affect support for Green parties? Lately, climate policy has shifted from pricing carbon to subsidizing clean energy. Policies that impose concentrated costs trigger backlash, but what happens when benefits are concentrated and costs diffuse? I examine how subsidies for rooftop solar panels shape political behavior in Germany. I argue that subsidies channeled through homeownership can generate resource and informational effects that redefine homeowners as active participants in the energy transition. Using administrative and panel survey data with difference-in-differences designs, I show that owning solar panels increases homeowner support for the Greens and the likelihood of joining environmental interest groups. Further evidence indicates this stems from owners perceiving financial benefits, gaining information about complementary policies, and engaging in collective action. These findings suggest that climate subsidies can generate an endogenous source of support for fast-tracking the climate transition, albeit at the cost of increasing wealth inequality between recipients and non-recipients

          What are the electoral consequences for Green parties when implementing energy transition policies? Despite broad citizen support for climate action, these parties can face electoral punishment even when policies align with their core mandate. We argue that perceived governing incompetence drives electoral punishment against parties leading the green transition. We examine the argument using high-frequency survey and census data in a difference-in-differences design, leveraging the unexpected 2023 leak of Germany's Building Energy Act. Our analysis finds that counties with a higher share of carbon-based heating systems experienced a significant decline in Green party support. This punishment is driven by former Green voters switching allegiance, notably to the CDU/CSU, due to a generalized decline in perceived Green competence. Our results suggest that also governance, beyond material costs, can undermine the implementation of the green agenda.

    This paper studies variation in mass attitudes towards the Russo-Ukrainian War. Although most Europeans express dismay at Russia's aggression against Ukraine, more ambivalent or even pro-Kremlin positions are not rare. Drawing on the literature on foreign policy and wars, we hypothesize that support for the aggressor may reflect a quartet of factors: economic interests, ideological preferences, political cues, and disinformation. We probe the role of these factors using an original survey conducted in five countries (Czechia, France, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) and spanning over 12,000 respondents. The results of three types of analyses reveal that neutral and pro-Kremlin positions, supported by significant segments of European society, are minimally related to economic interests. They are most strongly tied to political cues, followed by disinformation and ideology. These findings carry important implications for containing Russia's influence over Europe's public opinion and contribute to the literature on public preference formation in the field of foreign policy.
